adb push <local> <remote>

# Copies the remote from the device to local
adb pull <remote> <local>
```

### remote shell

adb shell monkey -p app.package.name

# check process limit
adb shell "/system/bin/device_config get activity_manager max_phantom_processes"

# disable phantom-processe limits causing termux to exit with signal 9
adb shell "/system/bin/device_config set_sync_disabled_for_tests persistent && /system/bin/device_config put activity_manager max_phantom_processes 2147483647"

# re-enable them
adb shell "/system/bin/device_config set_sync_disabled_for_tests none && /system/bin/device_config delete activity_manager max_phantom_processes"
