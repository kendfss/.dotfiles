For each name, indicate how it would be interpreted if used as a command name.


# Produce a more verbose report.
```zsh
whence -v
```

# Print the results in a csh-like format. This takes precedence over -v.
```zsh
whence -c
```

# For each name, print ‘name: word’ where word is one of alias, builtin, command, function, hashed, reserved or none, according as name corresponds to an alias, a built-in command, an external command, a shell function, a command defined with the hash builtin, a reserved word, or is not recognised. This takes precedence over -v and -c.
```zsh
whence -w
```

# Causes the contents of a shell function to be displayed, which would otherwise not happen unless the -c flag were used.
```zsh
whence -f
```

# Do a path search for name even if it is an alias, reserved word, shell function or builtin.
```zsh
whence -p
```

# Do a search for all occurrences of name throughout the command path. Normally only the first occurrence is printed.
```zsh
whence -a
```

# The arguments are taken as patterns (pattern characters should be quoted), and the information is displayed for each command matching one of these patterns.
```zsh
whence -m
```

# If a pathname contains symlinks, print the symlink-free pathname as well.
```zsh
whence -s
```

# As -s, but if the pathname had to be resolved by following multiple symlinks, the intermediate steps are printed, too. The symlink resolved at each step might be anywhere in the path.
```zsh
whence -S
```

# Expand tabs when outputting shell functions using the -c option. This has the same effect as the -x option to the functions builtin.
```zsh
whence -x num
```

If name is not an alias, built-in command, external command, shell function, hashed command, or a reserved word, the exit status shall be non-zero, and — if -v, -c, or -w was passed — a message will be written to standard output. (This is different from other shells that write that message to standard error.)

whence is most useful when name is only the last path component of a command, i.e. does not include a ‘/’; in particular, pattern matching only succeeds if just the non-directory component of the command is passed.
